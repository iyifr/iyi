<p>I read a book about investing from Robert Kiyosaki called "What the rich invest in that the poor and middle class do not". 
I was 16 at the time, That was the first time I felt a spark that I could actually build something.. like a business or a company.
I soon forgot all about it and went on to university to study engineering. 
 </p>
 <p>I realised that when i graduate, I'd just learn to code and try build things, so why wait?</p>
 <p>I left during my first year to focus on programming and pursuing other interests.</p>

 <p>While i learnt to code, i read a lot of great stuff on the internet, the internet can sometimes be one big library where you can learn about anything if you're curious enough</p>
 <p>I read so many fantastic blog posts ( from Naval, levelsio, Paul Graham to name a few ) and got inspired to blog too.</p>
 <p>In a big way, these posts set me on a good path, it shaped my perspective to see the world and society as an unfinished product</p>
 <p>To realise that there's still so much to stuff to to do and build, like the homie Naval said</p>
 <blockquote>"To give society what it wants but does not yet know how to get"</blockquote>

 <p>I wanna pay the debts back and share my journey and thoughts on here.</p>
 <p>I hope you learn something and get the confidence to pursue your projects too.</p>
 <p>Blogging has gotten less popular now, people do this type of thing on twitter but my brain can't handle that app for now. Too many thoughts, less thoughts are better. Less noise.</p>
 <p>I had this nice podcast project with my friend, might run that back too!</p>
