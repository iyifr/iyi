  "When life let's you swing, swing hard. 

You never know when your arms will get chopped off.

Or when the game will be over. 

Remember that you're born alone and will die alone. 

No one can live for you.

Living for you.

Live for yourself because it's the right thing to do.

Risks are best taken when you're young and people don't depend on you.

We tend to inhibit ourselves more than is necessary.

A good risk to take is one that will make you better whether it fails or succeeds.

The best risk to take is one that will pay off immensely and leave you utterly dejected if it fails.

You will die.

You will cease to exist.

Your eyes will see color one last time and fade out into utter nothingness.

Are you really living ?

Are you learning, growing ?

Are you bearing your trials with love and with acceptance of how fate is unfolding ?

Are you living a lie to please someone else ?

Do you even have the self awareness to know which life you really want to live ?

For too many people, they realise too late.

I hope you realise now and take your chances.

When life let's you swing, swing hard.

You never know when you arms will get chopped off.

Or when the game will be over.

Remember that you're born alone and will die alone.

No one can live for you.
