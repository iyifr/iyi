The university system sets most people up for a life of chasing scraps.

People, who by themselves are naturally ambitious, learn to settle for what is fashionable, seems to earn well and doesn't make a dent in the world.

Dead jobs at boring companies.

Boring work.

Average income.

It gets worse the less connected you are.

It's not a conversation about what's fair. We're way past what is **"fair"**.

However, in the last five years a new field of work has gotten very popular here. 

Along with a new way of doing this work. 

And it's changed the way a lot of young people view work and careers.

I'm talking about tech and remote work.

## Tech ?

The tech boom in Nigeria changed things for the better, even though it brought it's own peculiar challenges. 
But this article is not about the challenges. 
It's about the triumphs. 

I'm very young, not even 23 yet.

Yet i have a skillset that could be an asset to any tech company, regardless of domain.

I do interesting, fulfilling work. 

I play with different types of programming languages. 

I open some graphic design tool on the web and try to design things, suprising myself every now and then.

I work with brilliant people every day.

I read code written by the best of the best. 

Engineers working for some of the biggest tech companies in the world. 
Some of the most talented individuals in my field, on this planet. 

I can email them,

I can go on github and collaborate with them.

I learn technologies that make me feel capable. 

I can build cool things completely on my own. 

There's many more like me, even better than me, and they're all from this continent. 

[Levi](https://youtu.be/lCJYm14Ks3w?si=W5IE2j6UeQ4GN4fk), a coder with a great youtube channel, said that Nigeria produces some of the best developers in Africa. 
That is true. 

I know some exceptional Ghanian programmers and designers as well.
Both male and female. 

Some of us do *really* great work and are projected to be future greats, like [degreat](https://degreat.co.uk/).

But it wasn't always like that.

## It wasn't always so.
It makes me think back to 25 years ago, when my parents were just starting their careers and how different things were. 

- Running countless errands for superiors in the office as a new grad. 

- Manually chipping at boring files. 

- Dealing with office drama.

- Commuting to far distances for work.

I mean no disrespect, but most banking and consulting companies are boring!

The people there do honest work, but I'll pass, BORING!

This is work people today need to club all night and step down litres of alcohol on the weekends to live through.

I mean no disrespect to certain forms of employment, as this is honest work that fed many of our mouths and nurtured us through school. 

It's also work that paid for the education that enabled us to dream of brighter futures and many more blessings. 

I feel a deep gratitude for that.

But I'll put those inhibitions aside, to help you, the young, "GenZ" person to see the contrast betweeen that and a type of work out there for you to do that's insanely exciting. 

A type of work where, what you put in has little to do with what you get out. 

A type of work that's exciting and that you can point to and be proud of!

You can create something that creates value for lots of people, from your bedroom.

I wrote this article at my desk, in my bedroom, for example.

You can work with the best of the best in the world. 

You think it can't be done?

You're wrong, people are doing it.

Or you might tell yourself, 

**Only genius nerds with a monstrous intellect can do that**

But you would not only be wrong, you would be blind.

Unwilling to see what's right in front of you.

It can be you, it should be you.

It's a whole lot easier than it was 10 years ago, in fact it's much easier than it was 1 year ago!

It's unfortunate that "tech" (or what the average Nigerian's idea of it is) has become fashionable, and being a fashionable nigerian is something you want to avoid at all costs. 

**Fashionable Nigerians are insufferably naive and negative**

## Do useful things
I want to make an argument for why you should try and make useful things. 

People who do useful things are the exception, not the norm. 
It's hard for people who do useful things to be naive or negative. 

Doesn't that sound good ?

I also want to make a second argument based off the first one, 

The way you can start doing useful things is by learning and deliberate practice.
 
I'm talking about becoming dangerously capable at a skill.

I'm talking about knowing how to program (and program well!) 
- How to design, 
- How to weave data like a wand, 
- How to work cloud infrastructure, 
- How to communicate like a god in writing, 
- How to speak in public. 

If you pick a handful of these things and try to become the best in the world at them, every unit of work you do will lump together to create results out of your wildest dreams.

You might fail. 

It will be **very, very hard** and some days you will feel like backflipping off your roof. 

But it's so worth it. 

Avoid reductionist and zero-sum mindsets. 

> Tech is over-saturated

> Everybody wants to be a tech bro

> Tech is not all that.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with people wanting to learn high-income skills. 

The problem starts when these people don't have a benchmark of quality to compare themselves to.

The problem further worsens when the field is in fashion or popular. 

There's many people who want to earn a great income, tech is one of the many ways to do that. 
It's also one of the hardest ways to do that. 
But i won't shit on anyone who expresses desire for a better career trajectory. 
My beef is with people who think there's any easy path to get something valuable. 

Tech is pretty competitive.

Incompetence in a competitive market is not just disadvantageous, it's disqualification, or worse.. invisibility.  

Unless, of course,you're well connected or you're a skilled conman. 

But then what is the point ? 
Your work will never touch lives, instead you will work against the people who are capable of touching lives with their hard-earned competence. 

If you're a conman, thief or disingenuous person,You actually set the community back. 

- I don't respect you. 
- I don't want you in my industry. 
- You're stinking up the playing field. 
- You're indirectly reducing other people's credibility simply because they are of the same nationality.

I only respect people with *hard-earned competence*

Everything worth having is **HARD-FOUGHT**.

You choose your target and you stride towards it with graceful technique. 

You laugh in the face in the obstacles in your way. 
It's absurd i know. 
But if you think life is supposed to make perfect sense all the time, you're deluded. 

If you don't want to try for it, why should you have it ?

To think that you can waltz into an industry without competence ?
You won't get very far. 

Do you remember what i said about these fashionable Nigerians ??

A sizeable chunk of fashionable nigerians are in tech.

You know them by their doings.

They are loud on twitter and quick to give low-effort opinions. 
They are either grifters or at the peak of **Mount Stupid**.


!["The dunning kruger graph"](/dunning-kruger.webp "The graph.")

<small> The horizontal axis represents **competence**, the vertical axis represents the person's (wrong) **estimation** of their competence. <small />

Tune it all out. 

Their opinions that they are way too eager to share online are not even worth it. 
It's all mindless brain candy that inhibits you from following your curiosity intensely.

You want to work very hard, to garner the respect of people who are competent and at a higher level.
People you really **respect**.

Posturing on social media suggests to the rest of the world that you have **arrived** - at the peak of **Mount Stupid**.

Engaging with people who posture suggests to the rest of the world and to yourself subconciously that these **influencers** are worthy of imitation and/or respect.

# Striding with graceful technique

Follow your curiosity intensely, it knows you better than you know yourself. 

Work on difficult things. 

Read books that make your brain feel like it's sweating.

Learning should not be fun in the way that it's passive and not challenging enough.

Learning is not what you do in between hours of mindlessly scrolling social media.

Learning is sitting down and being determined to understand difficult concepts. 

Learning is examining your work and being rigorous and obsessive.

Be ready to dive deep and remember what you've learnt.

Your goal should be to fear no book, concept or person. 
If you don't try to be the best, don't even think about becoming good.

# I'm asking you to do something well. 
My dear friend, I want you to do useful things.

I want you to build beautiful things.

Things that other people can use. 

Things that delight people.

So much that they will throw money at you for it.

So beautiful and significant that you feel immense pride for the opportunity to do it. 

I want you to feel and **be** dangerously capable and confident. 

Don't bend to these reductionist mindsets and zero-sum social games.
There's enough cake for everyone. 

Oh, and don't equate school to education.
It's not the same thing.

At least, not if you want to do [great work](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

## We need each other.
I remember reading an impactful letter Steve Jobs wrote to himself, which i will reference. 

> I grow little of the food i eat, and of the little i do grow,
> I did not breed or perfect the seeds <br /><br/>
> I do not make any of my own clothing <br /><br/>
> I speak a language I did not invent or refine <br /> <br/>
> I did not discover the mathematics i use <br /> <br/>
> I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate <br/> <br/>
> I am moved by music I did not create myself <br /> <br/>
> I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming or most of the technology I work with. <br /> <br />
> I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. 

You owe it to the world. 

I'm asking you, in fact, begging you.. to do something well.

We need each other.

It's never too late but we both know you could've been a day, a month, or even a year earlier.

And so you need to get to work.

Now.

Don't wait, don't settle.

Now.
