I'm African, from Nigeria. Born and raised here. I'm one of millions\* ( i think ) programmers here
on this continent.

I want to talk about doing open source work from the perspective of a programmer living in and
working from Africa.

I'm not a popular open source guy... neither have i done anything significant in that respect.. yet.

I'm just always on Github looking at issues, asking questions, and creating issues myself. Oh and I
read A LOT of open source code.

Do i have ideas for open source stuff ? .. naturally. It's because of the things I do... and of
course the curiosity that has led me down steep rabbit holes.

Just merely saying "More Africans should do open source" is a sloppy, lazy, sentiment. There's
plenty of dead repos on Github from African programmers with open source ideas.

I suspect there are three main reasons why they abandoned it

- Couldn't pour themselves into it full time and maintain it properly.
- Wasn't good enough to take off
- Didn't even try to publicize the project.

### It's not easy.

Open source is weird... It's not that big a deal to do, until it is.

When one of my startups IPO's for billions of dollars, I'd start a grant for open source programmers
to have run-way for a few years so they can figure out how to sustain themselves while working full
time on their open-source stuff... i.e start doing consulting, freelancing, etc.

I'll talk more on why open source developers deserve some no-strings attached money later on.

You need to make something people want. I think that's a universal rule of thumb for making any kind
of technology. You need to make something someone out there wants. That someone is most likely going
to be yourself. You could make something you desperately want, or you could tinker till you
accidentally make something amazing.

Then you have to -

- Spread the word and tell as many people as possible.
- Add new features, improve the API
- Make amazing docs.

Making the thing is easy, but making it useful to other programmers, this takes hard, boring work.

If your little open-source project takes off, and you're living as a programmer in Africa, How
should i phrase this...

**You have work to do**

You have work to do, and it's not easy to do it alongside a full time job

Don't believe me ? You can ask the creator of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).
[Segun Adebayo](https://adebayosegun.com).

People need what you made. They like it even. This does not financially benefit you in a big way..
like your job does, especially in the early stages of the journey.

Most of the gritty work will be towards the end of your v1.

- Making the docs, making them good.
- Lots and lots bug fixing.
- Collecting feedback.
- Changing the API for some weird edge case

Okay, you get my point ? This is why there's so many dead repos buried in the software engineer's
github or local computer.

Also, I must say.. It's now possible to get rewarded financially for your open source work.. There's
dozens of platforms addressing this need. Which is amazing. But I wouldn't bet on that, alone. And i
wouldn't also get into open source for financial rewards.

Becoming a cracked programmer is a fantastic reason to get into open source.

> Cracked - being highly competent or skilled.

I'll talk more about becoming cracked through open source later.

### So why do open source ?

Open source is about giving.

Giving, Giving, Giving.

Giving of yourself, tirelessly working with no end in sight.

You gotta just love building stuff.

Or you just have to really hate the current state of things.

It sucks so bad you roll up your sleeves and get to work.

Open Source is doing tireless work without getting a **THANK YOU**, Without getting credit or a
cheque of 100,000 dollars when some AI company IPO'es off open source software you built. But you
don't complain.

I want to believe you feel a sense of pride, seeing your thing in the wild like that. That's because
it's not about what you can get... it's about what you have to give.

Avoid grifting. Avoid having a taker's mindset.

Don't call your startup an open source startup if some parts of your platforms are closed source.

Don't try to make profit off people's hard work without taking the proper steps, attribution and
what not...

### Please don't do this

Most importantly.. you wouldn't write an article vaguely saying "open source" is the way to a remote
job in US on a fat salary.

That would be a pathetically ignorant thing to do.

Africans read that and go crazy. "$100k a year!!" , "Relocate to the US!!". Getting a job like this
can seriously change the average programmer's life here. You seriously think it's just Americans and
Europeans reading your blog ? You're selling a narrative that doesn't help anyone.

You won't get a job in tech just by doing open source.

You get a job in tech by being a cracked programmer and providing overwhelming evidence that you are
skilled.

> Cracked - To be incredibly skilled and valuable.

It's hard and even I, the writer of this blog post is navigating this unskillfully at the moment
(but getting better)

### The OSS Contribution CheckList

Here's a short checklist of things you need to remember before contributing to open source code ..
And yes, for 99.999% of what counts as open source software, you need to have some experience
programming to contribute.

- Understand what the project is about.
- Read the source code and documentation as thoroughly as you can.
- Do your best work and follow due process the maintainers have set.
- You should probably make an issue, first.

### Africans in Open Source.

The header for this section is weird because you never see anyone say "Americans in Open Source".
People just build cool shit, but things are conspicisiously hard here and the mindsets required to
be a builder need to cultivated _intentionally_

If you're itching to see Africans do more open source work then start a technology company that's
innovating at the frontier, hire the best engineers in the schools here and start building some cool
thing. You'd be in uncharted territory technically and since your engineers are brilliant and
ambitious, they'll come up with creative ways to solve problems and then they'd open up their
frameworks and libraries for others to use. This is where some of the most popular open source stuff
started, out of necessity, not of "festivals" and people who have never touched open source code
parading as panelists.

If you're itching to do open source work yourself, the creator of Chakra UI is a great place to
start, read the story https://github.com/readme/podcast/building-Chakra-UI

Spread the word about programming, get more people writing code.. early. Set up social rewards and
cash rewards for being ambitious, and for working on stuff that's at the frontier. OH YOU MEAN
HACKATHONS.. yes hackathons. Someone should get all the cracked children on this continent (myself
included) put them in teams and ask them to do build something cool and see what happens.

Companies that rely on having a good developer community should pour more into the community with
hackathons, grants... etc. etc. I'm looking at you Paystack.

We need more hackathons and programming competitions for secondary school students. It's not just
about maths, english, WAEC and JAMB.

I did ZERO programming in high school. There'd be infinitely more tech pouring out Africa if the
founders started their technology journey much earlier and didn't have to work to earn money whilst
also learning to program or being in their "learning" season.

How many of our children are drowned in python from the age of 12 ?

All i learnt in computer class back in high school was Microsoft word, Microsoft-access and some
Corel Draw... stuff I'd use if i was a banker (I guess ?) or graphic designer from the 90's.

I don't think high schools in Nigeria prepare kids to be technologists.

This is why Alt-school Africa can come about and sell you dreams about "learning tech" in a few
months and landing a remote job paying in _US DOLLARS_.

I need to write a seperate article about this and i will.

This article is about a specific aspect of technology which is creating and documenting code for
others to use freely, while making that code open to anyone to read and contribute to.

### Saying Thank You!

For the companies, you have to say thank you. No matter how small your way of doing it is. Don't act
like you could've done it without these hard working guys maintaining the libraries you depend on to
ship your product. It's easy as a founder or product engineer to pat yourself on the back and get
all the credit, but it wasn't just YOU. You gotta pay it forward and show some gratitude for the
people creating these cool things that help you bring your product ideas to reality.

### Ad Summa

- The best way to get into open source is necessity. Second best way is by accident. Just make sure
  you're reading a lot of code and gaining an intuition of how things _really_ work.

- Open Source is a lot of work you'll probably not get paid enough for, and if your thing is really
  good, people will fork it, build on top of it, IPO and never say thank you.

- Everything is a wrapper of something (or a lot of things), If you're building something,
  acknowledge what you're a wrapper of and pay it forward.

- There's a lot of programmers with talent that don't have the opportunity to do what they love, in
  a big way, simply because they are in the wrong environment and don't see a way out. Endless
  festivals and tech concerts don't help these people!! Building cool shit does and getting
  publicity for it does. Encourage this, fund this and celebrate this and we should be fine.
