**Blue Truth**: Sooner or later, this present moment is going
to be your last.
You are alive, for now. Feel your heart beating in your
chest. Soften your belly and relax your jaw. Feel your
heart beating deep in your body, and feel your heartâ€™s
rhythm radiating outward, pulsing in your hands and feet
and neck. Feeling your heartbeat, relax open as if
offering your heartbeat to the world.
While feeling your heartbeat as an offering to all, feel
how you live your moments. What did you do today?
What are your plans for tomorrow? Who do you love and
how deeply?
No matter how much money or love you have made,
one day your legs will become cold and numb, your heart
will stop, your breath will cease, and all will disappear. In
some now-moment as real as this present one, your life
will end. Are you ready for your death? Are you ready for
the death of your children, your parents, and your
friends?
