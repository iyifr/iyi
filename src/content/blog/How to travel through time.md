title: 'How to travel through time'

  "If you figured out how to keep a log of all the data in the universe, and kept snapshots of it everytime this data changed, you would become able observe the flow of time like a stack and insert yourself at some arbitrary snapshot you want to inhabit.

## Intro

Both of my sisters are currently busy with exams, usually my younger sister hangs out with my
brother while he does the dishes, but since she's absent, we hung out as I was doing the dishes.

I enjoy doing the dishes, I feel like it sparks my most creative and fringe thoughts. As any older
brother does, I start to talk to Dolu (my brother) about time travel. I hadn't thought about time
travel for a while until yesterday. When you watch a lot of sci-stuff as a kid, some ideas persist
and others fade.

I said to Dolu,

> The universe is just one big container of data, that holds the state.

Data about everything. And when i say everything i mean EVERYTHING.

( I'll use the word "state" alot in this article. State is the latest description of the details of
something)

I also said that what we experience as the flow of time is gazillions of particles moving through
space, with each particle assuming a new state (or description of it's properties in relation to
other particles).

At this point i pick up a plastic bowl and beat it into a shape and say that what i just did changed
the description of the plastic bowl. Some of it's characteristics changed. It's position changed.
All sorts of stuff about it changed.

At this point, my brother is very confused.

He asked a question which made me examine my argument a little more..

> "If I don't move or breathe and the plastic bowl remains where it was, how come time doesn't
> freeze ?"

Both the changes we are able to observe and the ones we cannot will affect the global state. There
are several atoms around you changing at a rate that you cannot describe or understand because it's
changing randomly, everywhere, all at once.

I made another statement off the top of my head -

> Every time the state changes we move forward in time, with a new version of the universe.

## Candid Description

Imagine that the state box contained ALL the data about our universe. All the data about a gazillion
and something atoms down to the last detail.

Some atom has decided to move three inches. Some atom somewhere else on the lattice has decided to
bobble to the left a little bit due to some other thing. The description of the universe has
changed. The snapshot has changed.

Every time this snapshot changes, we move forward in time.

> To shift time backwards, you have to reset the global state of aeons of data about the universe to
> the snapshot of it at the exact point in time you wish to travel into.

> To _travel_ back in time, you'd have to not only shift time backwards, you'd also have to merge
> yourself into the state and press play so that the changes can continue to occur from that
> snapshot onwards.

> To shift time forwards, you would have to accelerate the changes and randomness and arrive at a
> new snapshot of the universe several trillions of iterations ahead.

There are some things you would need to figure out.

## Problems

You cannot be a part of the state in order to change it. If you try to meddle with state in some way
(especially if you're going backwards in time), your actions can have side effects on other pieces
of the state will get logged and then the state gets tangled. This gives rise to _paradoxes_ which
is a whole sub-genre of time travel in itself.

It is also beyond our limits of computation to store and keep track of the data required to travel
through time.

Just think about time as a big stack of data about the universe at various points.. the past, the
present, the future.

The pieces of data at the top are probabilistic and that represents the future. Probabilistic as in
we're taking a guess as to what the data may be.

The past is deterministic, the stack contains perfectly accurate data about the events of the past.

The present is perpetually unfolding at a stochastic (random) pace.

Only an entity outside of the universe can have access to this stack, it's so much data that it's
difficult to comprehend.

In programming terms, we don't have read-access or write-access to this stack, to the best of my
little knowledge on physics.

Did I crack time travel ?

Do you think my reasoning is critically flawed ?
