Tuning into your inner voice can be very difficult, especially when you are in an environment with
"micro-bullies"

These aren't your full-blown assault type bullies though, these are the bullies that make you feel
small for having any thoughts or interests of your own.

Yeah, that person that always has something snarky or dismissive thing to say about your interests
or your point of view, let's call them a micro-bully. It's my belief that your inner voice is the
summation of the following

- Your DNA
- Your experiences
- The information you have accumulated and retained over the years.

It's your inner voice that morphs into taste over the years. The things that attract you or repel
you. The things you find delight in doing. The things you are hopelessly apathetic about ( I
seriously don't care for "xyz" )

The annoying thing about these kind of bullies is that they assert themselves in such a confident
way to try to trample on your POV. They have this false narrative of being "realistic" and will
often put you down when you show any sign of original thought.

The anatomy of a snarky comment should be familiar, if it is not.. then you probably fit too neatly
into society.

These snarky comments ticks either or both of these boxes

- What you desire is unrealistic.
- What you desire / are interested in is too low status ( "can it feed you ?" type comments)

#### WHAT YOU DESIRE IS UNREALISTIC

In some contexts, the things you desire to do can be quite ambitious, so relating them with your
peers or parents might not go as well as you thought. Usually these snarky comments are just a way
of saying --- "This thing you want to do is unfamiliar to me and I feel threatened by this ambition"

Sometimes your perspective may be too far outside the scope of others and they just cannot see where
you are coming from with certain ideas or interests.

#### WHAT YOU DESIRE IS LOW STATUS

Some cases, what you want to do is not regarded as 'lucrative' or something you can say at an
expensive dinner with your "peer group". It's also most likely something your African Mom will have
a hard time boasting about to her friends.

Let's give some good examples

A (formerly) academically gifted child who wants to drop out of college to manage his friend who's a
promising musical artist.

A friend group of youths from middle class families, all lining up to take good jobs out of
university (nothing wrong with this).. and then one guy in the friend group decides.. "Nah, I want
to start a gym and be a personal trainer"

So what does it feel like to be on the other side, to be the one that's

- kinda weird
- thinks they're "special"

Let's even not go that far... almost everyone has things they find specifically interesting and
enjoyable, the problem is they don't believe they _can_ develop these interests and live the
lifestyle they prefer for fear of disappointing their friends / family.

Or they could be scared because they don't have examples to look to for guidance or inspiration.

#### DON'T GROW UP

You're probably not gonna grow out of it if you tried. You know that there's stuff you want to do
that's unheard of for people "like you"... people from your home town, people in your family...
whatever it is.

For example, it may be unheard of that a guy from Ketu here in Nigeria can start the next big tech
company. I hesitated to say AI company because there will be no next big AI company :) The science
has already been applied.. I digress...

So imagine you're that guy in Ketu rn that has some "spicy ideas" and knows there's more to you.
There's more to this perspective you have built up.

Now imagine telling your fellow Ketulian (resident of Ketu)... "I'm going to build an Artificial
Intelligence company".... Even now that tech is almost worshipped... they'll give you a good hard
stare up and down.

So what will you do ??? Will you let your perspective shrink to your fellow ketulite's size or will
you continue to nurture this perspective that gives you enthusiasm, the dreams that jolt you out of
bed everyday ?

My advice - Don't grow up.

When you were a kid, you couldn't make much sense of people's snarky comments, you just read what
you liked, did what you liked and watched what was on the tv bro. External influence was at minimum.

Keep expanding your perspective, don't be limited in your view of the world. Just because you're in
Ketu doesn't mean Ketu is all there is. Okay, Boys usually become mechanics in Ketu ? But you want
to code and you want to build sites... GOOD! You want to build rockets ? ... GOOD! Find somewhere to
start and keep educating yourself and expanding your mind.

These desires are good, don't let the ketulite look down on you. They can say they mean well, but
that's a pesky detail.

Imagine regretting not doing something later and the reason you didn't because the naysayers
naysayed.. but but.. they "meant well" and were "realistic"

The other thing is, you may not have it all figured out and are hoping to one day to find that
spark. You'll never find it without building any momentum. You have to start going in the direction
you want to go and you'll find out that there's serendipity somewhere along the way. Don't just be a
dreamer.

Kay, that's all from me. Adios.
