I often find myself with an opportunity to give advice related to programming. 

There are so many different answers i've given to questions like

- How do i get into programming ?
- How do i get good at programming ?
- How do i know what projects build ?

Sometimes they don't even finish their question, i just jump in and start yapping away.

I enjoy answering these questions because i remember struggling to get into programming too.

My programming ability skyrocketed this year. 

It's still very low compared to my idols (obviously), but it exploded upwards substantially in the last few months. 

I'm just trying to say, i have so much context on programming, i don't know what to do with it. 
I am stuffed with context. 

My point is that my context (experiences) inform the advice i give and it may become quite abstract or quite technical. 

I think great advice generally has these key ingredients.

- Actionable
- Clarifying ( giving you a clearer mental picture of something )
- Informative ( giving you additional information )


A part of good advice that makes it actionable is that the person receiving it walks away with a clear idea of how they can benefit from the advice. 

So two things.. 

> It's not too specific that it's unrelatable

> It's not too abstract that - it's incomprehensible

Here's my profound advice for people who want to learn how to code.

### On Learning

Learning how to code is one of those things that will change the way you think, but not only that, it will change your idea of what you're capable of. 

You may not be consciously aware of it, but your mental landscape has a general 'mold' 

There's a shape to your thoughts and your thinking patterns and it affects how you approach certain scenarios.

Within that **mold**, there's dozens of different contours and edges which have their own branches.

You can think of it as shapes within a shape.

When you learn programming, (or anything really), you are welding new shapes into your brain. 

Think about that on a physical level, this is an energy-consuming thing, and tedious to get started. 

This is why learning is, hard, it feels **hard**, it feels unnatural and like you're trying to wrap your head around something but it's not quite there yet, and then you grasp it for a split-second and then it's gone again.

What's happening when you are trying to learn, your brain is expending energy to adopt a new perspective, a new model, a new set of patterns to **think**.

When you learn more on a topic, you learn it's vocabulary, almost like there's sort of glossary that you have to hold in your memory to properly understand and discuss a particular field.

> The programming model

Your brain's willingness to adopt and start to use "The programming model", depends on how easy it is for the shape of your **thoughts** and **thinking patterns** to resemble more closely, that of a programmer's.

So the first time it doesn't click with your coding, (the code isn't working, panik!!!), your brain is forced to try to think like a programmer, and there's missing context, so it panics, and that's a good thing!

You just have to fill in the gaps!

So, that's informative right ?

You learnt something new. 

**Learning** > Your brain is incorporating new shapes.

**Frustration** > Your brain struggles to put it's new shape to work

**Elation** > You have successfully applied your newly acquired shape. 

This is why i always say things like..

**We are so back** 

And the infamous - **It's over**

The cycle will take you to the highest highs and drag you back down to the lowest lows.

### On programming

So, how do you get over the hurdle, and start thinking like a programmer ?

Here's my second piece of profound advice. 

Come closer fledgeling padawan...

You have to **rawdog** it. It will only get easier after a period of **suffering**. 

You have to read alot of code, that you barely understand.

This seems very boring for the budding programmer, but it's the only way to get good over time, by really giving an effort to wrap your head around difficult concepts.

The brilliant educator, **Katherine Birbalsingh** in conversation with Jordan Peterson, said that the way you successfuly **teach** children, is not teaching them **how** to think in some abstract way. 

> The way to teach children, is to feed them boat loads of knowledge and give them tools to assimilate this knowledge and form their own connections.

I think she refers to **connections** here as one's distinct style of thinking.

A valid criticism of the traditional education system is that it's too vested in theory without an opportunity for a students to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.

The conclusion i've come to is that is that you should swing between both as much as you can. 

Structured study of a wide range of concepts <> Hands-on practice.

I read this [reply](https://x.com/cramforce/status/1824502095338409987) to a tweet by the CTO of vercel

> Collect programming hours like pilots collect flight hours.

You have to write a lot of code.

But how do you even figure out what code that is ?..

**By writing lots of code**

The workflow typically looks like this:

- Create a github account for storing your code online.
- Find a coding tutorial on youtube
- Search for link to source code, which is available for most videos(usually in the description)
- Read source code while watching the video
- Play around with the code, change it a little, drift off from the video.  
- Get stuck, read blogs, ask chatgpt or claude
- Keep changing code till it's perfectly working.

This will get you, very, very far. 

Then it evolves into something like this 

- Browse through github
- Find cool project
- Star the repo
- Read the source code
- Fork the source code
- Download to your local computer
- Tweak the source code, change the design, add features
- Try to merge what you've changed with the original coder's version, they can approve or deny this request. 
- Do this many times.

- Build cool projects of your own

But here's the tl;dr.. If you're completely new with programming

Learn some html.

- [Free code camp HTML & CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)


Then pick up some javascript.

- [Learn some javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

- Then sign up to [github](https://github.com)

- Then read this book - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

Done all of that ?

You have acquired some hard-earned context!!
Well done...
You are on the path.

Now start putting some of your code on github!

Gorge yourself with information of the things you've just learnt, so you can get more creative and have ideas for more projects.

Follow your curiosities most intensely and practice a little bit every day.

That's it young padawan, That's how you to get into software.
