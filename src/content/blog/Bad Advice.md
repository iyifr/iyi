I often find myself with an opportunity to give advice related to programming. 

There are so many different answers i've given over the years to questions like

- "How do i get into programming ?"
- "How do i get good at programming ?"
- "How do i know what projects build ?"

Sometimes they don't even ask, i just jump in and start yapping away.

But i find that, most of the answers i give are for the *present* me, the one that's learnt 4 programming languages in the last 4-5 months, the one that's joined a new team and worked on 2 exciting AI & ML projects already, the one that started out self-taught and slogged through it all to arrive at this now.

My programming ability skyrocketed this year. 

It's still very low compared to my idols (obviously), but it exploded upwards substantially in the last few months. 

I'm just trying to say, i have so much context, i don't know what to do with it. 
I am stuffed with context. 

My point is that my context (experiences) inform the advice i give and it may become quite abstract or quite technical. 

I think great advice generally has these key ingredients.

- Actionable
- Clarifying ( giving you a clearer mental picture of something )
- Informative ( giving you a new perspective )
- High effort 
- Tone-aware 
- Specific

High effort doesn't mean the advice has to be some long monologue, but it has to be profound and well thought out. 

A part of good advice that makes it actionable is that the person receiving it walks away with a clear path to benefiting from the advice. 

This is the part i struggle with.

It has to be

> Not too specific that it's unrelatable

> Not too abstract that - it's unrelatable

So, let me give a better attempt. 

Here's my profound advice for people who want to learn how to code.

Learning how to code is one of those things that will change the way you think, but not only that, it will change your idea of what you're capable of. 

You may not be consciously aware of it, but your mental landscape has a general 'mold' 

There's a shape to your thoughts and ideas, and consequently, your abilities.

Within that shape, there's dozens of different contours and edges which have their own branches.

You can think of it as shapes within a shape.

When you learn programming, (or anything really), you are welding new shapes into your brain. 

Think about that on a physical level, This is energy-consuming, and tedious to get started. 

This is why learning is, hard.

It feels unnatural to your brain when trying to utilize a mold that just hasn't taken shape yet.

But you have to realize one thing, 

You must earn your own context (experiences), one way or the other.

Your context here is your vocabulary, the battle scars, the nuanced knowledge that's not in any book or course.
The things that can only be taught by simply writing lots and lots of code.

It's supposed to be hard and take some time.

When people complain about how javascript is **HARD**, you have to realise that javascript is hard, but it's definitely learnable as long as you have the necessary mental faculties. 

Why ?

Because millions of people have learnt it.

Not many as clever as you!

What's happening when you learn, is that your brain is expending energy to adopt a new perspective, a new model. 

> The programming model

Your brain's willingness to adopt and start to use "The programming model", depends on how easy it is for your brain to pick up and apply the 'mold' or 'shape' of a programmer's mind. 

So the first time it doesn't click with your coding, (the code isn't working, panik!!!), and you're forced to think like a programmer, your brain goes into panic mode  - there's missing context.

Now you have to fill in the gaps!

Your browser, the websites you use daily, your computer, the internet, the code. How it all fits together. 

You have to fit all of these tiny details into your mind. 

So, that's informative right ?

You learnt something new. 

Learning > Your brain learning new shapes.
Frustration > The learning cycle is working as expected
Elation > You are successfully apply your newly acquired shape. 

This is why i always say things like..

**We are so back** 

And the infamous - **It's over**

The cycle will take you to the highest highs and drag you back down to the lowest lows.

So, now how do you get over the hurdle, and start thinking like a programmer ?

Here's my second piece of profound advice. 

Come closer young padawan...

You have to **rawdog** it, it will only get easier after a period of **suffering**. 

You have to read alot of code, that you barely understand.

This seems very boring for the budding programmer, but it's the only way to get good over time, by really giving an effort to wrap your head around difficult concepts.

The brilliant educator and headmistress, **Katherine Birbalsingh** once expressed that, the way you teach children, is not teaching them **how** to think in some funky, abstract way that's a valiant but poorly informed middle-finger to the traditional education system, NO.

That's like teaching cooking techniques and tricks to someone who doesn't know how to light a stove and can't differentiate pot from pan.

The way to teach children, is to feed them boat loads of knowledge and allow them to assimilate this knowledge and form their own connections.

Do you see the vision ?

The way to truly learn is to absolutely immerse yourself in *quality* learning material and hours of practice.  

I read this [reply](https://x.com/cramforce/status/1824502095338409987) to a tweet by the CTO of vercel

> Collect programming hours like pilots collect flight hours.

You have to write a lot of code that *you* find exciting. 

But how do you even figure out what code that is ?..

**By writing lots of code**

The workflow typically looks like this:

- Create a github account
- Find a coding tutorial on youtube
- Search for link to source code, (usually in the description)
- Read source code many times while watching the video
- Implement with spice, play around, add your own features, change the code! 
- Get stuck, read blogs, ask chatgpt
- Keep changing code till it's perfect.

This will get you, very, very far. 

Then it changes to this 

- Browse through github
- Find cool project
- Star the repo
- Read the source code
- Fork the source code
- Download to your local computer
- Tweak the source code, change the design, add features
- Try to merge what you've changed with the original coder's version, they can approve or deny this request. 
- Do this many times.

But here's the tl;dr.. If you're completely new with programming

Learn some html.

- [Free code camp HTML & CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)


Then pick up some javascript.

- [Learn some javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

- Then sign up to [github](https://github.com)

- Then read this book - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

Done all of that ?

You have acquired some hard-earned context!!
Well done...
You are on the path.

Now start putting some of your code on github!

Gorge yourself with information of the things you've just learnt, so you can get more creative and have ideas for more projects.

Follow your curiosities most intensely and practice a little bit every day.

That's it young padawan, That's how you to get into software.
