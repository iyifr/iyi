This blog post is an angry rant about Taika Waititi being an absolute nutjob.

Taika kinda ruined thor for me, im ngl. 

As in, the character.. THOR. The god of thunder, from the MCU and well, norse mythology.

At the time i saw it, **Thor: Love & Thunder** felt like the final nail in the coffin for the MCU.

The resounding **GBIM!** on the floor, the MCU had been falling off, but now it had finally made impact with the ground.

I am passionately saying this for all to know - that movie was DISGUSTING, APPALING AND HORRIDLY BAD.

It was pathetic. 

I genuinely don't have a single good thing to say about the movie. It was more like time graffiti.

How do you take a piece of sacred fiction and shit on it with a loud fart to top it all off ?

You gave jane foster THORS HAMMER so she could become what ?? Thorette ? 
(arrant woke nonsense) 

And then reduced thor to an NPC ex-boyfriend and caretaker to a child that is not HIS.

I hate to sound like a glazer for thor, but if you take a pretty powerful character with tons of interesting plotlines and end up with **Thor: Love & Thunder**, how are you still in a job mate. 

I think the MCU nerfed thor to some degree, but in this movie taika really pulled up with the surgical laser to fry thor's balls. It would've been a success for the woke mob at the very least if it was a watchable watch, yet still emasculating for Thor. What's the whole point of a movie if it's so unbearably shite you can't watch it? 

It was all a disjointed, colorful *mess*, i would say. I was visibly disgusted by the scene where all the kidnapped kids eyes started to glow and they all started fighting together against the villain. I pretty much wanted to get up and leave at that point lmaooo.

Anyways, I think the THOR character finally got some vindication and some freaking justice with the new animated series *Twilight of the gods*

Let me be honest with you, I don't care much for norse mythology. Why would i need to? I'm freaking african man.

However, when I watched *Twilight of the gods*... wow. That was intense. 

It's set up to be a truly epic story with no juicy details left out, an on-screen adaptation of the mystically mythical with all of it's richness, texture, DEPTH.

All the dark magic, humans and god's co-inhabiting, ambitious lines, amazing deliveries, poetic action sequences, war speeches, naked valkyries, **NAKED VALKYRIES**.

**Hmph!**

The gore is also apparently a whole theme. 

Like, just imagine my HORROR when thor, the supposedly disgraced ex man-wife, obliterates some guy's skull with one swift swing of his hammer, no questions asked. 

No stupid puns. "We are so back" - I quietly murmured. 
The thor in this series is vastly different to the one you know, for better or for worse.
