In many ways, paradise would be decentralized. There would be no human ruling parties or
governments. Everyone would have to take full ownership over their individual existence. Paradise
could mean the collapse of the current model of society, with survivors taking ownership for
themselves and having the ability to tap into the infinite human potential.

Using the tools of historical evidence and extensive trial and error... to self correct, and to get
back on the path of ascent.

Rapid Ascent on the maxim of human existence.

Infinite improvement in human ability and achievement.

The frontiers for innovation would be innumerable.

We know humans have an individual ability to build, to think and to learn. But in this model of life
it will be necessary, urgent and accessible.

Imagine the possibilities if it was not an option to rely on a centralized body or centralized
concepts for survival, coupled with the absence of mental "barriers to entry".

There would be new ideas everywhere because people would have to build their own. We would build our
own houses, farm our own food, figure out how to build the things we need. Figure out how to ensure
the survival of our individual self, and then the collective. Figure out more things about our
world, question most of what history knew and attempted to explain of this existence...

It would be the most important diversity of all, diversity of ideas.

This has it's dangers as well, as it is wise to avoid clouding one's judgement with optimism. There
are cases where centralization works and decentralization does not. Not all ideas will be correct.
Not all ideas will preserve this model.

Thanos (a Fictional Character) was once scripted to say this -

I have no clear idea on tackling this problem. Except from having a centralized code of behaviour
designed by a higher entity. To keep the value exchange human, to reliably distinguish between
acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. To preserve the model.

Another important piece of the puzzle is that there has to be fluid collaboration between humans
with an intangible medium for value exchange. The exchange is way different to what we have today
where we exchange finished or half-finished products with currency in the market to gain value, it
would be a knowledge exchange, a symbiotic relationship where you scratch my back and i scratch
yours.

Person 1 - Wants to drink beetroot juice.

Finds a beetroot farm

Asks the first person he sees,

> How do you plant beetroot and make juice ?

Person 2 - Needs to build a roof for a house

Sees a house with a wooden roof in the distance

Asks the occupant

> How do i build a simple wooden roof like yours ?

In both cases the interactions would trigger a knowledge exchange. I will let your imagination fill
in the gaps as to why this exchange will happen.

As OPPOSED TO WHAT WE KNOW TODAY

Person 1 - I sell roof installation services 20$/hour

Person 2 - I sell beetroot juice 25 dollars a pack.

The exchange being discussed has no medium, the connection is purely human. It's also incredibly
inefficient. Why ? Most decentralized systems can be inefficient in theory, but for good reasons.
Once you define the concept of money as we know it today you veer closer to centralization due to
nuances that arise from having a tangible exchange medium. In many cases, you have to sacrifice the
immediate benefits of efficiency for decentralization.

The optimal scenario for rebuilding society would be to have an intangible exchange medium ( or none
at all ), governed by an unambiguous moral code that is centralized.
