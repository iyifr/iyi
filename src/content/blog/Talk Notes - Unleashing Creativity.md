#### Introduction

The conversation about creativity is a critical one .. to see your potential as a developer or as a
human being you have to solve problems and to continuously suprise yourself and that requires
creativity and strong persistence

Creativity is the tendency , desire and ability to make things , the desire to take an idea from
your head and use your intuition and skills to transform an idea into something you can see and
interact with , that you can explain to someone else

So why be creative as a developer ? You'll enjoy work more Your boss will be delighted You'll get
recognized by your peers Your confidence will skyrocket

I want to state that my goal for this workshop is to help you realise what being creative could look
like for you and how to translate to building software... I know this is supposed to be very
technical but i will attempt to have you reason on the subject of creativity before i show you my
process and give some tips

I'm going to introduce a couple of mental models.

I'm a big fan of condensed knowledge that does not change and that's exactly the point of having
mental models

So the first model i want to talk about is inverted thinking So it works like this if i wanted to
become more creative, and I'm trying to figure out how. Instead of thinking what i should be doing,
what if i thought about what i should not be doing

So if you want to get creative as a developer what should you completely avoid ?? If you wanted to
create websites or API's or design systems. What are the things that ensure you never create

- A poor learning mindset. (You feel sad because you don't know enough to act)
- Waiting for the perfect time (Stalling) (You never act)
- Fear of Failure (You never act)
- Being Comfortable (You don't feel like you need to act)
- Getting Distracted (You feel overwhelmed and pulled apart and thus you cannot act)
- Lack of persistence (When things go south you cannot see it through)

Bonus

- Not Trying New Things

So if we didn't do these things for a long enough period, then we don't need we to do much else we
have successfully become a creative force.

So let's try to think through removing these things

### A poor learning mindset

I want to introduce the concept of games to you. In one way or another we're all familiar with games
There are set of rules and the objective of the game is to win There are some games where there are
no definite set of rules and the objective of the game is to keep playing. It's kind of the same
with life and with learning. If you have a finite goal in mind

I want to get a job I want to build this product I want to be a senior engineer

A person who says i want to do this for a very long time and let's see how it goes is going to be
more creative because for him creation is something never ends. You keep doing it.

So when you stop a finite goal in mind then you can see beyond just the daily hustle and bustle into
a bigger and brighter future.

So you have to imagine you doing something and never stopping that thing, how would you do it.
Obviously with a lot of passion and joy. I'm not saying you're going to code forever, I'm saying
that to unleash your creativity you need to make it such a enlivening experience that you never want
to stop. And if you're always learning and putting stuff out in the world, the dance never ends.

### WAITING FOR THE PERFECT TIME

Here are some things i say to myself when i catch myself when I catch myself wasting time Fortune
favors the bold. There is no such thing as a perfect time. No person who ever wanted to achieve
something waited for the perfect time , for ample amounts of money or for his/her family.

One thing i know for sure is delay kills inspiration.

If you want to get more creative you have to start now to push your boundaries.

SOLUTION You can't just wake up and all your self-doubt will disappear, "Am i good enough?", "Should
i be doing this now?", "What if it doesn't work out".

Some people suggest loving yourself more and practicing gratitude but I'd be shocked if that
actually helped anyone (immediately).

The real thing people do is find ways to take the first action.

I've found that the most natural way of taking the big leap is not by forcefully supressing your
fears but gently leaning over your edge.

i) Break down the work required to the smallest piece. Then carry it out with your eyes closed, your
hands trembling, whatever it takes to lay that first brick, is worth it. After the first brick is
layed you have the foundation to lay a 1000 more on top of it, and it gets easier.

### Fear of failure

First of all what does a failure look like ? "A code review, you're getting cooked. Your code is bad
and your qualifications at this job are reviewed"

ORRR

"You botched your product launch and now you have 0 users on your big day"

"Or your code push to the main branch crashes the app in production"

You cannot always get it right because we all have blind spots and make human errors. A blessing
would be having an environment that doesn't punish you for human error. Through school and
traditional education, we've always been punished for errors we make in judgement or in thinking.
It's not even the event itself that's significant but our perception of the event, it's our feelings
of incompetence and how we think our peers and superiors see us.

To stop being scared we have to confront it fully. I have benefited alot from asking myself, what
does failure look like ? What does it really look like, in clear details ?

So i've tried something where i ask myself when I'm coding or trying to think about a side project
What are all the ways that this could fail and I answer the toughest questions, this way I have no
blind spots and that gives me the clarity i need to act

## Being Comfortable

One thing I've said to myself is that if you're not growing, you're dying. If you're not advancing,
then you're declining. So if not growing as a developer you're actually declining because the market
is growing. When i say growing as a developer I don't mean learning 50 new technologies at the same
time and buying all the courses on udemy, No. I mean pushing your boundaries, if you make 2D based
websites maybe next year make 3D websites. Maybe try doing the UI / UX design and learning how to
create cohesiveness in your UI Maybe you can try creating a Javascript library ? Maybe you can do
technical deep dives and explore the internals of web frameworks?

Maybe you can start a web design agency? Maybe you can build a startup?

The thing is being comfortable is linked very closely to your environment, your pay is good, the
bills are covered, you feel like you have arrived. The truth is that if you're not learning &
building you will stifle your creativity by not acting on inspiration because you don't believe that
you need to be doing more.

## Getting Distracted

A simple trick for avoiding distraction is to become obssessed with something. Something always has
to give way for the other. It's easier to be focused when you're obsessed because you don't have to
struggle, you don't consciously push yourself, you don't read self help books thinking something is
WRONG with you or rely on binaural beats. You just have to become obssessed , pay attention to
infinitely small details and enjoy your work.

Another piece of advice is setting up your environment for success, put your phone in another room
PLEASE. Mute social media. Be inaccessible for some time. Not everyone and everything deserves your
eyes and ears.

Focus & Flow States isn't something you read a book about or consciously do, it comes from setting
up your physical environment and mental landscape for success.

This might sound a bit hardcore but if you absolutely can't focus, delete all your social media and
don't re-install it no matter how bad the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) gets.

Yes, you won't know the latest tiktok sounds, You need to be a chad. Chad's don't know the tiktok
sounds. Chads build the future.

Okay, I know you can't tell but I crack myself up lmao. But seriously, your focus is important, what
you can build and become is more important than watching 1000 videos a day in quick succession just
because everyone does it.

Your brain needs less, LESS. Less stimulation, less garbage, less thoughts, for it to get into flow
state.

Now to my final point of the talk

#### LACK OF PERSISTENCE

An extension of the long term game point. You MUST put in your reps. You can put in the reps over 4
years. You can put the reps in 4 months. It just depends on how crazy you wanna look to onlookers.
But you must work. You must deserve it, except if you want to be a grifter, have crippling imposter
syndrome and other horrible things...

There's no hacks to consistency, you do what's required even when you hate it, even when it's the
last thing you want to do. You don't forget your goal. Your mind is relaxed, alert and free. You
know what you must do, so you do it.
