Theory of God

God creates.

The creation aspires to God by extending and distilling a part of itself into a seperate entity - it's own creation. 

Creation then develops the capability to do the same and repeats the cycle - Becoming God. 


### Critique of the theory of God

The confusion starts by questioning how the cycle begins. 

What was the first cycle ?

What started the first cycle ?

God or creation ?

Some religions proposes that we are the second cycle, that our God emanated from nothing and created all tenets of (our) reality.
 
Evolutionists and believers in the big bang will tell you we are the first of such a cycle. 
Spontaneously animated matter that evolved into the known universe. 

What if we are several cycles ahead?
