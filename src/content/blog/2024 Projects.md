The first quarter of this year is practically over. At the start of the year i set out to build 12
products. So far I've built two and I'm honestly just gonna do 4 max.

#### Karu

I worked on a product at the beginning of the year for restaurant managers to do inventory control
and financial forecasting. I wanted to call it Karu but the domain name is taken.

Where do restaurant managers even hang out on the internet ??? This is the challenge of a
bootstrapped startup. There's no funding for you to use on targeted ads and stuff like that.
Especially since it's B2B. I also procastinated on that landing page like craaaazy! I should run
that before the month ends and launch it. I also have no idea what to call it now lolol. But I'll
figure it out...

#### Drippd

The second project I'm working on is an e-commerce marketplace. Like an "etsy" or a "shein" but for
local brands here in Lagos.

Imagine you could shop for quality clothes and cut the market roundtrips, same way you would use
Amazon and Jumia... Overall, I hope we can bring something new to e-commerce the same way Paystack
did for online payments in Africa.

##### Svelte Supremacy!!!

I broke the rules of bootstrapped startup dev and used new tech for this project. I've been a React
guy since i started making websites, but I've been flirting with svelte for a long time. Watching
Rich Harris' [Rethinking Reactivity]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao") gave me the
final push toward switching to SvelteKit.

It's been a delightful experience. Yes, I have to read the docs every now and then to crosscheck but
it's scary how intuitive it is.

#### Open Sorcery

Asides from building these two products this year.. I might do some open source stuff. I dipped my
fingers into creating a server framework with file based routing (like Nitro.. the base server for
Nuxt). But my fingers were burnt. Charred even. File based routing on windows ??? Don't even get me
started for realll... I haven't given up yet, but it's likely it will only be available on the Bun
runtime. More details soon

##### Medusa.js but simpler.

I tried to use medusa.js to build the MVP for Drippd. So complex! I got the idea to build a
database-agnostic E-commerce SDK with some sensual typescript DX. It would allow devs to spin up
customized e-commerce experience in no time!, That's my only open source idea for now. May the DX be
unholy and the Github gods be kind to me.

##### Non-programming projects.

- I want to learn how the maths stacks up. Like how can one build up from Basic Number Theory to
  Complex Integration ?

- I want to learn about quantum physics and how we can reliably describe how atoms behave on the
  smallest of scales. I wonder if that will come handy in cracking teleportation or some other
  futuristic tech.
