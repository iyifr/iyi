- Next.js 14 with Server Actions.
- Typescript.
- Zustand state stores
- Turso
- Drizzle (The best typescript ORM)

### The Inspiration

A piece of software that would make it simpler to run stay on top of financials and sales.

I had a quality lead, who owned a restaurant and I interviewed him. I had many ideas on what this
software could do but by the time I interviewed him, I crossed out almost all of them.

Here's what i learnt from the interview

- Complaints are handled manually.

- Most accounting is done by hand, by the owner.

- Small bets are taken from time to time to improve offerings, based on customer feedback.

### _Accounting and Inventory Stock Control_

The goal now is to make accounting a breeze for restaurants and provide a stunning interface to do
it on.

Orda Africa is a VC backed startup that makes awesome software tools for restaurants. I found out
about orda africa very late and they've done an amazing job. The thing with these VC backed software
as a service companies is that you may not even need all their features.

But if there's one software every restaurant should use, it has to be software to make sure the
finances are in order.
