#### Motivation

Dart is a powerful and rich language. I want to build the library of choice for flutter developers
and other dart programmers to build API's.

#### Philosophy

I love the design philosophy of [h3](https://h3.unjs.io).

> A small core with a plethora of utility functions that have access to the request context.

It is built for composability and ease of use.

H4 makes it even simpler for Dart Developers to build API's. Using Dart also means more performance
with less effort.

#### Router

It uses a trie data structure as a router which is a highly effective and fast router that supports
different routing patterns.

#### Tutorial

##### Hello World.

```dart title="app.dart"
import 'package:h3/create.dart';

void main() {
  var app = createApp();
  var router = createRouter();

  app.use(router);

  router.get("/", (event) => "Hello world");

  router.post("/latecomer", (event) async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 200));
    return "Hello world, sorry I'm late";
  });
}
```
