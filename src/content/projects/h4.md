#### Motivation

It allows Dart Programmers to build API's in a high-level, expressive way. The design of the library
is similar to [h3](https://h3.unjs.io) in the typescript ecosystem, hence the name _h4_.

H4 is not as portable or designed for serverless Javascript Environments.

It's rather similar to a project like express.js which abstracts the low level http and networking
primitives so that developers can focus on creating robust API's.

#### Philosophy

I love the design philosophy of [h3](https://h3.unjs.io) with a plehora of utility functions that
are available which make it easy to reason about API's and write standard code. You can easily
reason about setting and getting request headers, parsing the request body and so on.

It also has amazing constructs for middleware (onRequest, onError) which make logging easy. _H4_ is
directly inspired by these API's where best helpful to create a simple and powerful way to build
server API's with dart.

You can set up a server on localhost in 3 lines of Dart and start returning requests.

#### Router

It uses a trie data structure as a router which is a highly effective and fast router that supports
different routing patterns.
