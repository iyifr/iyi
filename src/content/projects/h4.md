#### Motivation

Dart is a powerful and rich language. I'm exploring the possibility of using dart as my go-to scripting language.

#### Philosophy

I love the design philosophy of [h3](https://h3.unjs.io).

> A small core with a plethora of composable utility functions built in.

The following is an excerpt from the h3 docs.

> Composable utilities have huge advantages compared to traditional plugin/middleware approaches:

- âœ…Your server only includes and runs the code that is needed
- âœ… You can extend your server functionality easily without adding global plugins
- âœ… The usage is explicit and clean with less global middleware and plugins

H4 is built for composability and ease of use, as we'll see in the later parts of this document.

#### Router

It uses a blazing fast trie-router implementation that supports different routing patterns.

#### Tutorial

Enough yapping, let's write some code. Make sure you have dart installed.

```powershell
dart --version
```

<br />

Scaffold a dart app

```powershell
dart create app -t console-simple
```

<br/>

Then install H4

```powershell title="app/bin"
dart pub add h4
```

#### Running the app

Everytime you make changes make sure to run (or re-run) the dart file containing your _main_
function.

```powershell
dart run app.dart
```

<br />

##### Hello World.

```dart title="app.dart"
import 'package:h4/create.dart';

void main() {
  var app = createApp();
  var router = createRouter();

  app.use(router);

  router.get("/", (event) => "Hello world!");
}
```

<br />
Now go to your browser and visit localhost:3000.

Brava! <br />

_Hello world!ðŸŽ‰_

##### Let's fetch some data!!
